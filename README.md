# CurriculumTimeline
Curriculum Timeline, to show what you did and when.

Feel free to copy it; you can just change the data.json file and the charts will be automatically update.
If you add more/different tags than "education", "work", "volunteering" you may have to change the ids and title in the html body accordingly.

See example: https://carmignanivittorio.github.io/CurriculumTimeline/
